# MedPass
Medical passport safely stores medical relevant information for emergencies.

#### The big picture
The advancements in technology have made it possible to gather the information we produce. From the analysis of this data we can obtain insights, witch, in turn, make it very valuable. Businesses are intelligently using it for profit, such as google and facebook. 
  The practices of such business have raised the questions, who owns the information? arent they monopolizing it? are they to trust with our data. I believe, we, the source, are the owners, are entitled to do as we wish with the information we produce. We should be able to exchange it for services, keep it private or sell it for different porpuses. 
  They have monopolized the gathering, giving them to much power, and absolute power absolutely corrupts. They are not to trust, especially with our delicate medical information. We as owners should be in control, taking power back, empowering the individual.MedPass is a very small step, on a very long journey of owning your information. 

#### Functions
MedPass is a WebApp that stores on IPFS a small file with medical relevant information for emergencies and makes it available on the fly with a QR code. Helping your physician make faster and better decision.
  The QR code can be embedded on a bracelet, necklace, tattoo, or even on an inplated on an NFC. A tag will specify that it should be scan in case of an emergency. So scanning the code will give access to the information, such as:
 -Medications
 -Present disease
 -Past disease
 -Last words
 -Type of blood
 -Emergency number
 -Name
 -Insurance number
 -ETC.

#### Imagine
Emergency rooms can be messy, especially if there is a patient that is having a profuse hemorrhage. If the loos of blood is sufficient, a transfusion might be needed. For such transfusion  you need to know the type of blood, running such a test takes only a few minutes, but there is no time to lose. Here is where MedPass would be useful, giving the type of blood instantly.
